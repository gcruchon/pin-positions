# Pin positions

This is a tool for golf rules officials to be able to edit pin positions as they are setting up the course.

This tool allows two or more rules officials to edit pin positions simultaneously on different holes, and the changes will be updated in real-time for all officials.

For example is one team is working on holes 1-9 and another team is working on holes 10-18, real-time distances and statistic are published for rules officials to act accordingly.
